# linelint

A linter that validates simple "newline" and "whitespace" rules in all sorts of files.

## Usage

This is a project in development. Use it at your own risk!

```console
go get github.com/fernandrone/linelint
```

Just run it and pass a list of file or directories as argument:

```console
linelint .
```

Or:

```console
linelint README.md LICENSE linter/config.go
```

## Configuration

Use a `.linelint.yml` in the same directory to fine-tune your settings. See the example file [.linelint.yml] for an up-to-date example:

```yaml
# 'true' will fix files
autofix: true

# list of paths to ignore, uses gitignore syntaxes
ignore:
  - .git/

rules:
  # checks if file ends in a newline character
  end-of-file:
    # set to true to enable this rule
    enable: true

    # set to true to disable autofix (if enabled globally)
    disable-autofix: false

    # will merge with global configuration
    ignore:
      - README.md

    # if true also checks if file ends in a single newline character
    single-new-line: true
```

## Rules

Right now it only supports a single rule, "End of File", which is enabled by default.

### EndOfFile

EndOfFileRule checks if the file ends in a newline character, or `\n`. You may find this rule useful if you dislike seeing these ðŸš« symbols at the end of files on GitHub Pull Requests.

By default it also checks if it ends strictly in a single newline character. This behavior can be disabled by setting the `single-new-line` parameter to `false`.

```yaml
end-of-file:
  # set to true to enable this rule
  enable: true

  # set to true to disable autofix (if enabled globally)
  disable-autofix: false

  # will merge with global configuration
  ignore:
    - README.md

  # if true also checks if file ends in a single newline character
  single-new-line: true
```

## Docker Image

A public docker image exists at [docker.io/fernandrone/linelint](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fernandrone/linelint). It is published manually and I at the moment there is no versioning and no guarantees of updates.

```console
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/data fernandrone/linelint /data
```

To add a configuration file, just share it with the root volume of the container:

```console
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/.linelint.yml:/.linelint.yml -v $(pwd):/data fernandrone/linelint /data
```
