# linelint

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/fernandrone/linelint/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/fernandrone/linelint)

A linter that validates simple _newline_ and _whitespace_ rules in all sorts of files. It can:

- Recursively check a directory for files that do not end in a newline (or _strictly_ a single newline)
- Automatically fix these files by adding a newline or trimming extra newlines

Very useful in avoiding these warnings from GitHub ðŸ‘‡

## Install

See the [releases](https://github.com/fernandrone/linelint/releases) page for the latest version for your platform.

Alternatively, use `go get` to build from HEAD (might be unstable).

```console
go get github.com/fernandrone/linelint
```

See the [#GitHub Actions](#GitHub-Actions) and the [#Docker](#Docker) for their respective setup instructions.

## Usage

> This is a project in development. Use it at your own risk!

To run it locally, execute the binary and pass a list of file or directories as argument.

```console
$ linelint .
[EOF Rule] File "LICENSE" has lint errors
[EOF Rule] Ignoring file "README.md": in rule ignore path
[EOF Rule] File "linter/eof.go" has lint errors

Total of 2 lint errors!
```

Or:

```console
$ linelint README.md LICENSE linter/config.go
[EOF Rule] File "LICENSE" has lint errors

Total of 1 lint errors!
```

In case any rule fails, Linelint will fail with an error (exit code 1).

If the `autofix` option is set to `true` (it is `false` by default, activate it with the `-a` flag), it will attempt to fix any file with error.

```console
$ linelint -a .
[EOF Rule] File "LICENSE" has lint errors
[EOF Rule] File "LICENSE" lint errors fixed
[EOF Rule] Ignoring file "README.md": in rule ignore path
[EOF Rule] File "linter/eof.go" has lint errors
[EOF Rule] File "linter/eof.go" lint errors fixed
```

When all files are fixed successfully, Linelint terminates with with a success as well (exit code 0).

## Configuration

Create a `.linelint.yml` file in the same working directory you run `linelint` to adjust your settings. See [.linelint.yml](.linelint.yml) for an up-to-date example:

## Rules

Right now it only supports a single rule, "End of File", which is enabled by default.

### EndOfFile

EndOfFileRule checks if the file ends in a newline character, or `\n`. You may find this rule useful if you dislike seeing these ðŸš« symbols at the end of files on GitHub Pull Requests.

By default it also checks if it ends strictly in a single newline character. This behavior can be disabled by setting the `single-new-line` parameter to `false`.

```yaml
rules:
  # checks if file ends in a newline character
  end-of-file:
    # set to true to enable this rule
    enable: true

    # set to true to disable autofix (if it is enabled globally)
    disable-autofix: false

    # will merge with global configuration
    ignore:
      - README.md

    # if true also checks if file ends in a single newline character
    single-new-line: true
```

## GitHub Actions

This project is available on the GitHub Actions Marketplace.

Create a workflow file your repository's GitHub Workflow folder, for example `.github/workflows/main.yml`, like the one below:

```
# .github/workflows/main.yml
on: [push]

jobs:
  linelint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Check if all files end in newline
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Linelint
        uses: actions/linelint@master
        id: linelint
```

This will trigger a validation of all your files. Configure it using a `.linelint.yml` file at the root of your repository (see [#Configuration](#Configuration)).

## Docker

Public Docker images exist at [docker.io/fernandrone/linelint](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fernandrone/linelint). To use it, share any files or directories you want linted with the container's `/data` directory.

```console
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/data fernandrone/linelint
```

To add a configuration file, share it with the root volume of the container:

```console
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/.linelint.yml:/.linelint.yml -v $(pwd):/data fernandrone/linelint
```
