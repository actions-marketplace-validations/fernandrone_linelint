# linelint

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/fernandrone/linelint/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/fernandrone/linelint)

A linter that validates simple _newline_ and _whitespace_ rules in all sorts of files. It can:

- Recursively check a directory for files that do not end in a newline (or _strictly_ a single newline)
- Automatically fix these files by adding a newline or trimming extra newlines

Very useful in avoiding these warnings from GitHub Search ðŸ‘‡

## Install

See the [releases](https://github.com/fernandrone/linelint/releases) page for the latest version for your platform.

Alternatively, use `go get` to build from HEAD (might be unstable).

```console
go get github.com/fernandrone/linelint
```

See the [#Docker](#Docker) section for instructions on Docker usage.

## Usage

> This is a project in development. Use it at your own risk!

Run it and pass a list of file or directories as argument:

```console
linelint .
```

Or:

```console
linelint README.md LICENSE linter/config.go
```

In case any rule fails, it will end with an error (exit code 1). If the `autofix` option is set (on by default), it will attempt to fix any file with error. If all files are fixed, the program will terminate successfully.

## Configuration

Create a `.linelint.yml` file in the same working directory you run `linelint` to adjust your settings. See [.linelint.yml](.linelint.yml) for an up-to-date example:

## Rules

Right now it only supports a single rule, "End of File", which is enabled by default.

### EndOfFile

EndOfFileRule checks if the file ends in a newline character, or `\n`. You may find this rule useful if you dislike seeing these ðŸš« symbols at the end of files on GitHub Pull Requests.

By default it also checks if it ends strictly in a single newline character. This behavior can be disabled by setting the `single-new-line` parameter to `false`.

```yaml
rules:
  # checks if file ends in a newline character
  end-of-file:
    # set to true to enable this rule
    enable: true

    # set to true to disable autofix (if enabled globally)
    disable-autofix: false

    # will merge with global configuration
    ignore:
      - README.md

    # if true also checks if file ends in a single newline character
    single-new-line: true
```

## Docker

Public docker images exist at [docker.io/fernandrone/linelint](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fernandrone/linelint). To use it, share any files or directories you want linted with the images `/data` directory.

```console
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/data fernandrone/linelint
```

To add a configuration file, just share it with the root volume of the container:

```console
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/.linelint.yml:/.linelint.yml -v $(pwd):/data fernandrone/linelint
```
